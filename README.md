Task:

Create a cartSlice.js that looks almost the same as productSlice.js

It will not have any getProduct in it, or any extra Reducers, these should be empty.
It should contain an empty array in initialState that is called cart: []
It will not have any additional logic in there at the moment.
You will then need to connect this to the store, and check it in the redux dev tools of your chrome browser
